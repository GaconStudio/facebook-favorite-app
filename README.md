### How it works

Whenever you find yourself in love with a Facebook post or want to save it for later reading, just click the Facebook Favorite text link next to it.

The post and its text will be saved into your Google Chrome local data. When you need to access the data again, you can easy find them in Facebook Favorite. You can choose either to view them in embedded format or in a list and search for texts you want.

### Privacy assurance

I myself take your privacy seriously. Your data will be stored at your own computer, and are never transmitted or disclosed to either the Facebook Favorite developers or any other party.

### How do I make money?

Facebook Favorite is free of charge and is not designed to make money. It was created because I myself badly needed it for my own use, and I wanted to share it with the world.

### More Features

The list view in Facebook Favorite can help you to have a quick glance on your saved texts. If you want to dig through old posts, the search box will be useful.

If you prefer a more beautiful way to read your posts, Facebook Favorite lets you reads them as embedded Facebook posts in the Feeds view.

You can remove unwanted posts from Facebook Favorite by clicking the Remove text link next to them. If you want to clear all data, click the Clear Cache button.
